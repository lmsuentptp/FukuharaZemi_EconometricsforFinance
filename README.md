Seminar Syllabus: Introductory Econometrics for Finance
Textbook: Introductory Econometrics for Finance by Chris Brooks

Course Introduction:
Econometrics, defined as the application of statistical methods to economic data, holds a cornerstone position
in financial analysis. It paves the way for forecasting, risk management, and informed financial decision-
making. This course is designed to imbue seminar members with essential, hands-on econometric skills
tailored for the financial sector. Through a systematic exploration of pivotal concepts, modeling techniques,
and real-world applications, members will develop a profound grasp of financial econometrics and its
transformative role in modern finance.
Pre-Homework (For all sessions):
To enrich the learning experience, seminar members are mandated to complete assigned work/data analysis
tasks prior to each session. This practical engagement ensures not only a thorough understanding of key
concepts but also fosters an interactive and insightful classroom discourse. You must submit this 2 days
before the seminar day.
Weekly Sessions:
1. October 6h

online Chapter 2-5 (online)

Topic: Introduction and Overview of Financial Econometrics
Pre-Homework: Find out and create a data set of dairy or weekly or monthly data for more than 120 data
points (if you choose monthly, it means 10 years (12Ã—10) ) of more than 100 financial assets including
individual equity/equity index. It would be your database for the coming term.
Analyze a dataset of your choice (do NOT overlap the dataset each other among seminar members) based
upon the learning from Chapter 2 to 5. You should include almost all concepts such as regressions, copulas,
portfolio theory, statistical inference, hypothesis, Goodness of Fit, and parameter stability tests in the paper. It
should be a large report which should be A4 p10-20 pages. A senior should support a junior how to handle this
if necessary.
2. October 20th

: Chapter 6 (TBD)

Topic: Time Series and Financial Data Properties
Pre-Homework: Examine the autocorrelation structure of asset returns of your database and create a
forecast model with appropriate evaluation metrics. You need to show some learning concept such as
parameter stability and the concept in the Chapter6. Do not overlap the dataset each other.
3. October 27th

: Chapter 7 (TBD)

Topic: VAR model
Pre-Homework: Use your dataset to make VAR model. You need to consider endogenous/exogeneous,
causation, impulse function, instrumental variables and others based upon Chapter 7.
4. November 10th

: Chapter 8 (TBD)
Topic: Long-term Forecasting
Pre-Homework: Create a cointegration system of predicting a financial asset with your choice (do not overlap
each other). You need to add some economic variables to your original database or create a new database if
necessary. You must include unit root test, error correction model, engle-granger 2 step approach, spurious
regression and other in Chapter 8.
5. November 24th

: Chapter 9 (Online)

Topic: Unraveling Volatility: ARCH and GARCH Models
Pre-Homework: Apply an ARCH or GARCH model, analyzing volatility patterns by using your database. Also,
compare historical volatility, your ARCH or GARCH model, and implied volatility. It means that you must have
or add a financial asset with option market data.
6. December 8th

Chapter 10 (TBD)
Topic: Switching and State Space Models
Pre-Homework: Create a Markov Switching Model and Threshold Autoregression Model in a market you
chose, and check which is more appropriate. You can use either you dataset or others.
7. December 15th

Chapter 11 (TBD)

Topic: Panel Data

Pre-Homework: Make a panel data analysis with your choice in economics. You should find out dataset first
for the analysis. Do not overlap the data each other. You have to show the fixed effect and random effects
from the analysis and show which is more useful with your objective.
8. December 22th Chapter 12 (TBD)
Topic: Limited Dependent Variable Model
Pre-Homework: Create the probit and logit model with your choice of an economic/financial data set. You
need to test variable methos in Chapter 12.
9. January 12th

Chapter 13 (TBD)

Topic: Create a Simulation Model of pricing Options in your choice
Pre-Homework: Make a simulation of pricing options based upon Chater 13 and evaluate its appropriateness
in your choice of a financial market.
10. January 26th

Chapter 14 (TBD)

Topic: Fama-Macbeth and Fama-French and Extreme Value Theory (EVT)
Pre-Homework: Do the analysis of Fama-MacBeth and Fama French model in your choice of a market (do
NOT overlap each other). Also, do an event study by EVT.
