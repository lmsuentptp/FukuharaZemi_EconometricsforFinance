# Econometrics for Finance â€“ Fukuhara Zemi

This repository includes my coursework and applied projects from the *Econometrics for Finance* curriculum at Keio University's Fukuhara Seminar. The notebooks apply econometric models to real-world financial data using Python, with a focus on market risk, volatility, and time-series forecasting.
